Code:

Step 4:

Very similar to the Fibonacci code in the slides. 
We have two routines, one of them that checks the end condition, and the other routine that pushes/pops values and does the main computation.

Tfunc is first called, and its result is stored in $v0, and then moved to $s3 to complete the function (lines 74, 75). 

The atoi function is directly taken from the first project, as it is essentially the same thing.

Step 5:

No other steps were modified. I think.
